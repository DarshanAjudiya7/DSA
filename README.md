# 🚀 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my **DSA** repository! 🎯  
This is my personal collection of **Data Structures, Algorithms & Pattern Programs** implemented in **C++**, made for learning, practicing, and mastering problem-solving skills.  



## 📂 Contents
- 📌 **Patterns** – Star, Number, Pyramid & Creative Shapes
- 📌 **Sorting Algorithms** – Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick (Coming Soon)
- 📌 **Searching Algorithms** – Linear, Binary (Coming Soon)
- 📌 **Data Structures** – Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph (Coming Soon)
- 📌 **Practice Problems** – DSA Questions from different platforms (Coming Soon)
